title: 'Tell Me Something I Donâ€™t Know: Influences of World Knowledge, Contextual Fit, and Linguistic Regularity on Language Comprehension'
summary: 'To understand the influence of knowledge and current context on comprehension, we will measure event-related potentials (ERPs) to concept-feature word pairs (e.g., carrot-orange) that are embedded in sentence contexts that bias what type of knowledge is useful for comprehension. Analyses will focus on the event-related potential (ERP) response to the sentence-final feature words, including the N400 component, which has been associated with access to semantic knowledge (Kutas & Federmeier, 2011) and post-N400 positivities (including the anterior positivity and the posteriorly-distributed late positive complex or LPC), which have been linked to the detection and processing of (different kinds of) unexpected information. More specifically, the anterior post-N400 positivity has been linked to processes engaged when people encounter plausible but unexpected information, whereas the posterior positivity has been linked to the processing of both unexpected and anomalous words in sentences (Van Petten & Kutas, 1991; Van Petten & Luka, 2012).'
