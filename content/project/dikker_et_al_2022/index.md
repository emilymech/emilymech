summary: Systematic age-related neural dissimilarities in processing
dynamics and strategies raise fundamental questions about how the human brain supports
cross-generational communication, especially in light of accumulating evidence linking
interpersonal similarities in brain responses to communicative success. Yet despite its
prevalence and tangible health-related importance, naturalistic intergenerational
communication involving older adults is understudied. In this paper, we lay out why filling this research gap is critical in advancing our understanding of naturalistic communication, with implications for both science and practice.
