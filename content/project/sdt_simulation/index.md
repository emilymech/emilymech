title: 'Simulating Sensitivity to Reach Powerful Conclusions: A Comparison of Aggregated and Hierarchical Bayesian Models of Signal Detection' 
summary: 'In my final project for Psychology 555: Detection and Discrimination, I simulated data with condition effect sizes set to 0 and compared false positive rates of different analysis techniques including a 1. point estimate method, 2. bayesian generalized linear model (GLM), and 3. bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model (GLMM). I found that while the point estimate and GLMM methods maintained an acceptable alpha level across multiple simulated experiments, the GLM false positive rate alpha levels was as high as 0.59 across conditions.'
