          * "Emily did a fantastic job at simplifying complex topics so that all the students can understand. She taught at a very reasonable pace and always looked to clarify things if students seemed confused. She is by far one of the best teachers/TAs I've had over the course of my education."
          * "Emily. She was great and probably the best TA that I have ever had. I have nothing but praise for her and her teaching style. She is always able to break something down for the class and constantly walks around during lab to ensure that if we have any questions we can ask them. More TAs need to be like her!"

          * "I've had Emily in a couple of discussions. Shes always been a great TA and was always very charismatic and knowledgable of the material. She has great energy and seems very motivated to teach the material. She definitely knows her stuff and finds the best and most efficient way for us to learn the material. I like how she always relates the content to real life situations making it a lot easier to memorize. Thank you, Emily!"
          * "Emily is the reason of why I have been able to pass a previous class and allowed me to have a better understanding of this class. She has always been so incredibly patient through my continuous questions. Her constant helpful examples were the reason that I always was able leave office hours more confidently in my abilities than I came in. No matter how many times she had to reexplained she never seemed angry of frustrated with me and that was a great assistant. I greatly thank her for all the assistance."
