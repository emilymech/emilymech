        * Added to University 'List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students'
        * Select student evaluations:
          * "Emily did a fantastic job at simplifying complex topics so that all the students can understand. She taught at a very reasonable pace and always looked to clarify things if students seemed confused. She is by far one of the best teachers/TAs I've had over the course of my education."
          * "Emily. She was great and probably the best TA that I have ever had. I have nothing but praise for her and her teaching style. She is always able to break something down for the class and constantly walks around during lab to ensure that if we have any questions we can ask them. More TAs need to be like her!"
